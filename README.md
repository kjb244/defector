# Defector

An app that allows concurrent tracking of defects/bug across a team. Features live updates, web notifications, and chat functionality. 

## Languages/Frameworks

Defector is written in angular.js on the front-end (1.x) with socket.io and uses express with node on the backend. Diskdb is used as the database; if you expect a heavy database load you should refactor to use a real database.
